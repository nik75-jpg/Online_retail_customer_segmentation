Geographical analysis
receiving orders from 37 various nations.
United Kingdom alone accounts for 89% of orders and has the greatest client base (81.50% of total sales).

Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic have the fewest orders.

USA and Czech Republic have the greatest percentages of cancelled orders (62% and 20%, respectively), meaning that 62% of all orders have been cancelled.

DateTime analysis
The volume of daily transactions increased in the third quarter.

Closed on Saturday, don't get any orders on Saturday;

average sale on Sunday is low compared to other weekdays;

daily sale is high in second half compared to first half;

highest sale in November; sale is high in last four months compared to other months;

most orders are generated between 9am and 5pm; high number of orders in afternoon;

moderate number of orders in morning; and fewest numbers of orders in evening.

Conclusion on Customer segmentation (Clustering) :
Starting with the RFM model, we divided the client base into various groups according to their recentness, frequency, and monetary value. By calculating RFM_score and assigning RFM_group, we divided our clients into various categories.

RFM_group: RFM_group is the sum of the R, F, and M scores, with 444 being the best and 111 being the worst.
RFM_score: Where 12 is the greatest and best score and 3 is the lowest and worse score, RFM_score is the total of R, F, and M scores.
After that, we created three clusters using the Kmeans clustering algorithm, the elbow approach, and the silhouette method.

The 3258 clients in the first cluster label_0 have an average recency of 40, an average frequency of 103, and an average revenue of about 1950 dollars.

The second cluster label_1 has 1100 consumers with an average recency of 247 and a minimum recency of 138, meaning that these customers have not made any purchases in the previous four months. Additionally, the second cluster label_1 has only a low average frequency of 27 and a very low average value of roughly $472, compared to the first cluster_0.

The third cluster label_2 has just 12 clients, a maximum recency of 25, an average recency of only 5, an average frequency of 2813, and an average value of more than 100k dollars, all of which are significantly higher than those of clusters 0 and 1.

Then, using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, we formed three clusters once more using the dendogram to determine the optimal number of clusters. These clusters resembled those produced by kmeans. These clusters are named Premium customers, regular customers, and not so regular customers towards the conclusion.

Premium customers :Customers with very high frequency and monetary value but recent activity are considered premium customers.
Regular customers :Customers with average frequency and monetary value but recent activity are considered regular customers.
Not so regular customers: Customers haven't made any purchases in the recent 4â€“5 months, and the purchases they have made have been modest in value and frequency.
