Unsupervised machine learning (ML) is a subset of ML in which relationships and patterns in data are discovered without the aid of explicit labelling or human supervision. Identifying structure and patterns within data sets without any prior knowledge of what those patterns might be is the aim of unsupervised learning, in other words.

The identification of key client segments is the aim of this project.

The process of segmenting a client base into different groups based on their traits, behaviours, or demographics is known as customer segmentation. This enables companies to personalise their messaging, establish targeted marketing efforts, and enhance the client experience.

There are various methods for segmenting customers, such as:

Customer segmentation based on age, gender, income, education, employment, and other demographic characteristics.
Customer segmentation based on geography, such as a customer's country, region, city, or postal code.
Customer division based on personality, values, beliefs, and lifestyle is known as psychographic segmentation.
Customer segmentation based on behaviour, including past purchases, frequency of purchases, brand loyalty, and product use.
Businesses can better understand the requirements and preferences of various groups of customers by segmenting their client base, and they can then customise their marketing efforts to fit those demands. For instance, a company might develop various marketing campaigns for various age groups or geographical areas, or it might provide tailored product recommendations based on past client purchases.

Customer segmentation can be done manually by examining customer data or automatically by machine learning algorithms based on trends in the data. Customer segmentation is a useful tool for firms to enhance their marketing initiatives and offer better customer experiences, regardless of the strategy employed.
